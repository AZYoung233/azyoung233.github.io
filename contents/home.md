* Produced three papers in the area of multimodal sentiment analysis, one of which has been accepted for publication in NAACL 24 Findings.


#### Research Interests

My current passion revolves around building **EFFICIENT** system solutions to AGI, this includes:

1. <strong><strong>Machine Learning System</strong></strong> 
    * Training: Design more effective training system and algorithms, examples include [BMTrain](https://github.com/OpenBMB/BMTrain).
    * Parameter Efficient Fine Turing (PEFT): Improve LoRA-like architecture and low bit model compression. 
    * Long context inference: example includes [Cross Layer Attention](https://github.com/JerryYin777/Cross-Layer-Attention).
2. <strong><strong>LLM & LLM applications</strong></strong> 
    * CodeLLM
